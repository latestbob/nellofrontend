              value between individuals and organizations on a timely and
              consistent basis. This privacy policy will explain how our
              organization uses the personal data we collect from our customers
              and related partners when you use our website or subscribe to use
              any of our products and services.

            <p>
              Nello conducts business in a responsible and sustainable manner
              and ensures customer information is securely collected, processed
              and stored based on business requirements. In furtherance to this
              and compliance with industry regulations, Nello has made
              appropriate documentation, which includes a privacy policy. Nello,

              information is collected, used, processed, disclosed, retained and
              disposed of. Throughout this Privacy Policy, we use the term

              associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that
              person. We do not consider personal information to include
              information that has been made anonymous so that it does not
              identify a specific user.
